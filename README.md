# R-Code

Welcome to my R Code repository. This repository includes the walkthroughs of different analyses for exercises that I developed for for a graduate-level applied agricultural statistics course and am in the process of creating for an upcoming undergraduate internship focused on developing skills from the data collection to publication process.

This repository shows off the skills that I must often use in my day-to-day activities as an agricultural data analyst. If you have any questions about my analysis workflow please email me at julijacubinsphd@gmail.com. If you would like to know more about my agricultural research projects that helped me to develop these skills, please visit my website at bit.ly/julijacubinsphd.
