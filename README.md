# R-Code

Welcome to my R Code repository. This repository includes the walkthroughs of different analyses types that I have used in my teaching exercises for an graduate-level applied agricultural statistics course and an upcoming undergraduate internship focused on developing skills from the data collection to publication process.

This repository shows off the skills that I must often use in my day-to-day activities as an agricultural data analyst. If you have any questions about my analysis workflow please email me at julijacubinsphd@gmail.com. If you would like to know more about my agricultural research projects that helped me to develop these skills, please visit my website at bit.ly/julijacubinsphd.
